— What I want: Stock option fully optional.

— How I want it: On enter in a stock, the window is cleared and then a new one appears
where one can enter a value and save it or load a file, depends on drop-down option.
In the end, the stock would be set as the current one.

— What does it need to be done: 

"New" a window appears where a user must enter a name of a stock and the value of 
a soil mix. Then it is saved to a plantio class's list and view tab is set to that
specific stock.

"Load" a window appears where a user must enter a name. 
Then it is saved to a plantio class's list and view tab is set to that specific stock.


— What I need to do to get it done:

Before visual:
0) Make "default schedules" legal, assign them to a stock called "Default schedules".
1) Refactor "drawView" to depict current schedules instead of default ones.
2) Make a space where I can calculate schedules for the new (or current) stock value.


Two branches: "new" and "load".
1) make new stock saved to a vector of a plantio. (at least for now)
2) make load find and parse a stock to plantio class by name.
